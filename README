GSoC 2024 QuickSched

This is a clone of QuickSched from https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift/quicksched
Added CMake support, some "config.h" paths changed to support out of source build, so autoconf build may not work

# --------------------------
# Install spack (spack website has instructions)

# setup spack in bashrc if you want it always availablle e.g.

SPACK_ROOT=/path/to/where/you/install/spack
if [ -f $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh ]; then
  echo "Initializing spack"
  source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

# When spack is set up. 
# Do an external find to save building simple packages already on the system
spack external find

git clone http:// .... quicksched

# add quicksched package to spack
spack repo add /path/to/quicksched/spack

# install all dependencies we need
spack install --only=dependecies quicksched

# create an environment to build quicksched manually
spack build-env quicksched -- bash

# now build it
cmake ~/src/quicksched
