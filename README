GSoC 2024 QuickSched

This is a clone of QuickSched from https://gitlab.cosma.dur.ac.uk/swift/quicksched
Added CMake support, some "config.h" paths changed to support out of source build, so autoconf build may not work

# --------------------------
Install spack (spack website has instructions)

e.g. bashrc

if [ -f $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh ]; then
  echo "Initializing spack"
  source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

git clone http:// .... quicksched

# add quicksched package to spack
spack repo add /path/to/quicksched/spack

# install all dependencies we need
spack install --only=dependecies quicksched

# create an environment to build quicksched manually
spack build-env quicksched -- bash

# now build it
cmake ~/src/quicksched
